# Static build of Csound 7 + libsndfile + libsamplerate for Windows (x64),
# MSVC toolchain. The Windows counterpart to build_csound_static.sh
# (macOS/Linux, bash) - not a shared script on purpose, since MSVC's
# toolchain (cl.exe/link.exe, .lib instead of .a, the Visual Studio CMake
# generator, no lipo, no Homebrew/apt) is different enough that force-
# fitting it into the bash script wasn't realistic (see that script's own
# top comment for the same reasoning stated the other way around).
#
# UNVERIFIED - written without access to a Windows machine, meant to be
# run for real for the first time by GitHub Actions' windows-latest
# runner (or by you, if you have a Windows box - see the project README).
# Expect at least one round of real fixes after that first run, the same
# way the macOS and Linux branches of build_csound_static.sh both needed
# real build logs before they worked - that's the normal next step here,
# not a sign this was written carelessly. Two things flagged below as the
# most likely spots to need a fix are marked UNVERIFIED inline.
#
# x64 only - matches every other Windows target in this project
# (source/csound7_pd/pd_stub.def is also x64-only, see its own comment for
# why that matters there).

# 0. toolchain check: bison/flex via winflexbison (the standard Windows
#    port of GNU bison/flex - `choco install winflexbison3`, already done
#    by the GitHub Actions workflow before this script runs). Its
#    executables are named win_bison.exe/win_flex.exe, not bison.exe/
#    flex.exe - passed straight to CMake's -DBISON_EXECUTABLE/
#    -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE (same mechanism the macOS/Linux script uses), no
#    renaming needed.
#
#    Generator: uses Ninja, not "Visual Studio 17 2022" as originally
#    written. First real GitHub Actions run failed at the very first cmake
#    call with "Generator Visual Studio 17 2022 could not find any
#    instance of Visual Studio" - even though windows-latest runners do
#    have VS2022 installed, CMake's own VS-instance auto-detection didn't
#    find it in that environment. Ninja sidesteps that detection path
#    entirely: it just needs cl.exe/link.exe on PATH, which the
#    ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1 GitHub Action step (added to windows-build.yml
#    right after checkout) sets up explicitly via vcvarsall.bat, so CMake
#    never has to auto-discover anything. Also means Debug/Release is
#    chosen at configure time via CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE like the Linux/macOS
#    branches, not via --config at build time like the VS generator needed.

# 3. Csound 7, static, pointed at our own static sndfile/samplerate.
#    UNVERIFIED (the two spots most likely to need a real fix after the
#    first CI run, flagged here rather than guessed silently):
#      - whether Csound's codebase compiles clean under MSVC at all
#        without patches (it's a large, long-lived C/C++ codebase with
#        real Linux/macOS-first history; the CMakeLists.txt does have
#        WIN32-specific branches throughout, suggesting Windows support is
#        real and maintained, but that's not the same as "compiles clean
#        with zero fixes on the first try").
#      - whether winflexbison's bison/flex are close enough behaviorally
#        to GNU bison/flex for Csound's grammar files - they're built
#        from the same upstream GNU sources, ported rather than
#        reimplemented, so this is a reasonable bet, not a blind guess,
#        but still unconfirmed here.
#    USE_ALSA=OFF (present in the Linux branch of the bash script) is
#    intentionally NOT passed here - Csound's own InOut/CMakeLists.txt
#    only triggers that REQUIRED ALSA search `if(USE_ALSA AND LINUX)`,
#    which is never true on Windows regardless of this flag.
